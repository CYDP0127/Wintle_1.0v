 * Problems
 *
 * 2016.08.26 by Daniel
 *
 * 1. Bar progressing is not draggable.
 *    Probably use different way to progress than using Timeout function.
 *
 * 2. Bar is not progressing one tile per sec.
 *
 * 3. Make button to upload any audio files and create waveform blocks for each of them.
 *
 * 4. the size of the waveform block is always the same no matter how long audio file is.
 *
 * 5. Use setInterval and figure if the bar collides to other divs every 10 millisecond
 *    Not the best way because it takes lots of tasks
 *
